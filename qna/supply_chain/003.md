## History of Supply Chain Attacks
The United States has used both offensive and defensive
supply chain strategies in many wars,
including the Revolutionary War.
Although the British had a larger and better trained
army than the Americans,
they had to transport soldiers
and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean.
George Washington,
as well as other military leaders in the Continental Army,
recognized that disrupting the flow of supplies to the
British soldiers would destroy their ability to fight
effectively.
