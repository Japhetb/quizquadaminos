## Quantitative Risk
Cybersecurity needs to learn from other fields that
have massive risk, minimal data, and chaotic actors.

Hubbard & Sieresen describe how to

probability and statistics and describe risk
in financial terms using tools like
loss exceedance curves
to make ojbective financial decisions.
