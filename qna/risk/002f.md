## Quantitative Risk
In their seminal book
"How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk",
Hubbard & Sieresen state that cybersecurity needs
to learn from other fields that
have massive risk, minimal data, and chaotic actors.
They describe how to
quantitatively measure risk using
probability and statistics and describe risk
in financial terms using tools like
loss exceedance curves
to make objective financial decisions.
Loss exccedance curves are used
to quantitatively measure risk.
In this graph, the blue shows the probability
of financial loss due to cyber incidents
in the next year.
The red line shows how a new shiny widget
from the RSAC showroom floor costs $500K
(hence 100% chance of that cost) but
most likely saves $5M
(the loss reduction at 50% on the red line compared
to that point on the blue line).

However, the introduction of this new security technology
also introduces some supply chain risk as the widget has
a low probability (but high impact) as a threat vector
(as the customers of Solar Winds discovered).

# Question:
Which of the following could potentially
remove the crossover and reduce
the threat of loss due to supply chain risk?

## Answers
- spend a small portion of the savings on cyberinsurance
- spend a small portion of the savings on compensating security controls
- spend a small portion of the savings on assessing your suppliers' software development security practices
* all of the above

## Score
- Right:25
- Wrong:5
