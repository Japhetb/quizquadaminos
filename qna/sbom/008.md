# Background
## Roadmap for the attacker
The NTIA https://www.ntia.gov/sbom website
contains Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) at
https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_faq_-_20201116.pdf.
A common question is "Wonâ€™t SBOMs be a roadmap to the attacker?".
The FAQ has a much more complete answer but in summary:
"Theoretically, yes. In reality, the defensive benefits of
transparency far outweigh this common concern

All information is dual-edged,
but insufficient software transparency affords attackers
asymmetrical advantages.
